What's new in version 1.50  03-05-96
====================================

Compared to version 1.45, there are 110(!) changed patches and 22 new patches.
Mostly the changed ones are patches which I have made brighter sounding or
ones which now uses the new reverb effect. I don't have specific list of
those patches. I Also repanned the drums. Now they are panned the same way as
the original GUS drums. 

Well, here is some info on some other changes.

BRITEPNO     I made this patch about 35 KB smaller ! 
ACPIANO      New acoustic piano ! Sounds much like the bright piano.             
             Since almost all midi songs are usings this piano patch,
             I think it should be as bright sounding as possible.
CHURCH       New version of a church organ. Has much "smoother" sound than
             the one in pplt v1.45.
ACGUITAR     Back to new variation of the pplt v1.40 acoustic guitar.
             Should sound a bit better.
CLEANGTR     Smaller and reverbed version of the GUS original clean guitar.
ALTOSAX      The pplt altosax wasn't so good, so I made a reverved version
             of the GUS original patch.
WHISTLE      Reverbed version of the GUS original patch.
POLYSYN      The original one sounded better than the one in PPLT , so I made
             a brightened version of the original one.
FLUTE        Better flute. I changed of the wafeform which sounded pretty bad.
SYNBASS1     New synth bass 1 sound.
AGOGOHI      Agogos from PPLT 1.20
DISTGTR  and
ODGUITAR     Electric guitars are now brighter and more distorted sounding. 
AGOGOLO             -"-
BONGOHI      \
BONGOLO       \ Patches from "Rickypats" patch set. Greetings to Riccardo.
HIHATCL        /
HIHATPD       /
VIBSLAP      / 
HIGHQ        A loudened version of pplt v1.20 patch.
SNARE2       New electric snare. It is loudened and brightened version of
             a patch from "MaxPats".
TOMHI1       \
TOMHI2        \
TOMLO1         \ Loudened versions of tom drums from pplt v1.20
TOMLO2         /
TOMMID1       /
TOMMID2      /


Also the "Game Compability Mode" is obsolete since the full patch set is
already small enough. Loadpats can now load 80 patches with the full PPLT mode.
This is mostly due to the small piano patches.

I got rid off the solo piano midi files. I replaced them with other midi
files, which are: nostalgy.mid, psr510_4.mid, psr510_6.mid and pwrply.mid



What's new in version 1.45  01-21-96
====================================

I found a way to make the sound more spacy...something like a primitive
reverb effect. This technique is based on non-linear fading when
a note is turned off. It means that when a note is turned off there will
be short echo of the sound. This echo is much quieter than the note
before if was turned off and it does only make the sound richer. Mostly,
one cannot actually hear the "echoes" when more that one instruments are
playing at once.

Very BIG thanks goes to Peter Stinner who developed "Gustav v1.0" software
which made this possible.

These patches have been changed using the technique described before:

   accordn,  tenorsax, altosax,  sprnosax, distgtr,  odguitar, ocarina,

   honky, doo        Had a bad looping.                  
   stickrim          New stick rim sound. Not so "jazzy", but has a lot
                     clearer sound.
   nyguitar          Now has better panning.

   ppats.ini         \
   qpats.ini         / Harpsichord has been moved from qpats.ini to ppats.ini.


What's new in version 1.40  12-24-95
====================================

I noticed that the sampled Kawai XD-5 drums are not bright enough to use with
GUS. GUS needs brighter sounds, because it has no sound filtering nor
effects...
So, I searched for good drum sounds from internet and from my friend's EPS-16+
disks and found some too !
For the first time PPLT patch set is actually a bit smaller than the original!
  
  - cymcrsh1, cymcrsh2,        First time in PPLT cymbal crashes have looping,
                               so the sound won't fade away so quickly.
                               These are made from a patch I found
                               from the EPS-16+ disks.
  - hihatcl, hihatop, hihatpd  A good mixture of bright hihat sounds from
                               PPLT 1.20 and Roland TR-909.
  - snare2                     A variation of TR-909 snare.
  - kick1                      Andrew Du's contribution for PPLT v1.40.
                               Thanks Andrew !
  - cymride1, cymride2         More samples from EPS-16+.
  - stickrim                   New version from EPS-16+ jazz drum kit.
                               Very good !
  - snare1, claps, cowbell,    I didn't find good replacements for these,
    maracas, cymchina          so I just edited the old ones brighter.

                    ...and some other changes...

  - chiflead                   New chiff flute. Much better than the original.
  - honky                      New really bright Honky tonk piano made
                               from a EPS-16+ "house piano".
  - jazzgtr                    This patch has now a bit clearer sound.
  - unicorn                    [deleted !] The original version is still
                               somewhat better.
  - slapbas2                   Changed the lower wave to a better one.
                               Thanks goes to Riccardo Losselli, who provided
                               the wave.
  - nyguitar                   New, VERY GOOD nylon guitar made of 870 KB
                               GUS patch (sologuit.pat).
  - marcato                    New "String Section 1". Better loops and
                               brighter sound.
  - acpiano                    Loops and envelopes and improved.
  - synbass1                   Tuned to one octave up. Sounds better that way.
  - altosax                    Some changes in playing ranges of the waves.
  - Large.bnk                  Again, due to the various changes I had to
                               rebuild the bank file to catch up with the
                               sound quality.
  - Patmenu                    Some changes in files qpats.ini an ppats.ini.

  2980_1.mid, gottoget.mid     Here are two new techno midis to listen.
  groovin.mid                  This is one of the the best midi song I have
                               ever heard.


What's new in version 1.34  12-14-95
====================================

Version of Pro Patches Lite is same as version 1.33 plus the
v1.34 update.


  - acguitar        I made even better version of acoustic guitar.
  - harmonca        The middle wave had clicky loop and it was practically
                    unloopable, so I deleted it. With two waves the patch
                    is still good (better ?!).
  - nyguitar        Better looping.
  - acpiano         Was a bit off tune. Should be better now.
  - altosax         The middle wave was too quiet.
  - rockorg         Was a bit off tune. Should be better now.
  - gauge.vbx       This file was needed for windows version of Patmenu
                    to work.

What's new in version 1.33  12-09-95
====================================

Version of Pro Patches Lite is same as version 1.31 plus the
v1.33 update.

  - mutetrum.pat    Nice new muted trumpet.

  - large.bnk       Rebuilded version of the 1024 KB bank for MegaEm 3.06b.
                    All corrupted instruments should be fixed.

  - Patmenu v1.0    More descriptive command choices, which hopefully
                    makes it easier to choose correct mode for each
                    purpose.
     

What was new in version 1.32  12-05-95
======================================

There were serious bugs in both dos and windows versions of the
Patmenu program. This version now includes the bug fixes which
were previously distributed with file 'patmn_09.zip'.


What was new in version 1.31  12-02-95
======================================

   70 of the v1.30 patches are changed and there are 2 new patches.
   Now there is also Windows version of the Patmenu included ( wpatmenu.exe ).

   - There were several bugs in the v1.30 of PPLT. I fixed all the
     bug I found. It is useless to list them all here. Mainly the
     bugs related to bad loops and tunings.

   - Some people have noted about clicky abd poppy drums. I checked them
     out, but didn't find any problems. However, I made a little fade out
     into end of each drum to make sure that there aren't any volume ramps
     at end of the patches.

   - Now the acoustic piano of the MegaEm 3.xx emulation is also changed
     to 80kB small\acpiano.pat patch, so you don't have to suffer any more
     from the terrible original GUS piano !!


      snare1           - Brighter acoustic snare. Has a good effect to the
                         overall sound quality.

[new] acguitar         - The patch provided in the v1.30 of PPLT wasn't so
                         good as the one in v1.20. So I made a smaller version
                         of the v1.20 patch.

      odguitar         - The patch sounded better without one waveform !
                         Now it's smaller and better.

[new] nyguitar         - Someone noted that the guitars provided in the
                         MaxPats patch set were better. Well I tested
                         them and found that the nylon guitar was indeed
                         somewhat better. In fact it is a louder version of
                         the GUS original nylon guitar.


What was new in version 1.30 11-12-95
=====================================

   63 of the v1.20 patches are changed and there are 50 new patches.
   There are also two new midi files and 1 MB version of the patch set
   for MegaEm 3.06b included. Again, due to the changes the patch set
   is now significally smaller. Only 40 KB difference to the original
   GUS patch set !


   (1) New patches:

        27 NEW DRUM PATCHES FROM KAWAI XD5 PROFESSIONAL DRUM MACHINE with
        the old cymbal rides and TAMBOURINE FROM KURZWEIL K2000.

                                and also...
        
        small\acpiano- Smaller Acoustic Piano for games. It is used
                       automatically with Game Compability mode. May be,
                       in the future there will be also other smaller versions
                       of large patches in this directory ... 
        harmonca     - Not very good, but still MUCH better than the original.
                       IMHO the original one is the UGLIEST patch of the GUS
                       midi set !
        jazzgtr      - New jazz guitar. Waves ripped from a real jazz guitar
                       riff found in the internet.
        jungle       - Nice jungle effect from ProPats III.
        seashore     - New seashore patch from ProPats III.
        accordn      - At last a proper accordion patch.
        shakazul     - A new shakuhachi flute ! Well, it may sound funny
                       in some songs, but it's still VERY GOOD !
        clarinet     - Brighter and more realistic clarinet.
        clavinet     - New clavinet. It isn't so aggressive sounding than
                       the original one.
        woodflut     - New woodflut. More like the real instrument.
        sawwave      - The original sound is very good, just a bit weak.
                       So I made it louder.
        acguitar     - New, more bright version.
        

        Also made better versions of these GUS patches:
         surdo2, castinet, celeste, toms, gtrharm, percorg, synbras1,synbras2,
         and tubebell
     
   (2) Drum patches which I made louder:        
        surdo1, woodblk1, woodblk2, clave, tamborin,cymcrsh1,cymcrsh2

   (3) Other percussive patches that I made louder:
        timpani, orchit, syntom, taiko

   (4) Added mode bass to the sound of these patches:
        bassoon, tuba, pizzcato, church, contraba, cleangtr, distgtr,
        synbass1, acbass, slapbas1, slapbas2, fretless, mutegtr

   (5) Made these patches louder:
        vibes, xylophon, hitbrass

   (6) Other changes:
        cello        - Made it smaller ( 59kB -> 31kB ). Wonder why I didn't
                       do this earlier...
        acpiano      - The acoustic piano is now much brighter. It also has
                       large (about 10 KB) bidirectional loops, which makes
                       it sound more spacy.
        bottle       - It had a bad envelope.
        xylophon     - Made a bit of echo to the sound.
        odguitar     - Made it louder and more distorted.
        frenchrn     - corrected looping. Due to this the patch is also a bit
                       smaller.
        nyguitar     - Sounds better now.

        All multisampled patches and drums are now panned, which makes midi
        files sound more stereophonic even if the midi file does not contain
        any specific information about the instrument panning. 


   (8) New midi files in the "miditest" directory:
        etude.mid    - For demonstrating the new Shakuhachi flute.
        takeawil.mid - Just for entertainment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What was new in version 1.20 09-17-95
=====================================

   4 of the v1.10 patches are changed and there are 24 new patches.
   Due to the changes the patch set is now slightly smaller.


   (1) Made these GUS patches more or less better. "Better" is the key word
       here:

       mutetrum,pizzcato,contraba,belltree,revcym,santur,tuba,koto, woodblk,
       trumpet, clarinet, trombone, bassoon, altosax, sprnosax.

   (2) acpiano  - New acoustic piano. It's a smaller version (120 kB) of a
                  750 kB "Steinway piano" patch from Yamaha tx16w !

   (3) doo      - Made it smaller ( 79kB -> 46kB ). No quality loss.
       shakazul - The fixed version also available from file "ppl11fix.arj"
       startrak,
       atmosphr - The original patches had clicking loops ! They are now
                  corrected and I also added some flange effect to the samples
                  to make them even better.
       sweeper  - new, flanged, sweeper. It reminds me of those Tangerine
                  Dream analog synths back 70s'! Well, may be not... ;)
       agogo    - Smaller version and also has a bit better sound.
       vibes    - All new version from TB Proteus.      
       flute    - Lowered the sweep delay of the middle wave.
       tenorsax - New version (28kB), made from a 738kB Kurzweil patch.                  
       barisax  - New patch, made from three waves.
       cleangtr - smaller and better version.

   (4) snare1   - Changed to enhanced version of GUS Acoustic Snare.
                  The SCC1 version was good, but too soft.

   (5) patmenu -  Fixed a bug in the user interface. If one pressed
                  "r" wrong line was highlighted.

   (6) Included more midi files. The new midi files are made for solo
       piano. With them you can test the new Acoustic Piano patch:

       mephisto.mid , wishupon.mid and fantasi1.mid

What was changed in version 1.10 
================================

   These changes don't sound to be major ones, but they are...really.
   46 of the v1.0 patches were changed and there are 3 new patches.
   Changes are listed here:


   (1) These sounds needed to be made quieter:
          Cabasa, Maracas, Shaker and Basslead

   (2) I Discovered a new way to make a sound louder without making it distorted.
       I used that technique to these patches:
                Acbass,Fngrbass,Slapbas1,Slapbas2,Synbass1,Synbass2,Pickbass,
                Fretless,Bottle, Syntom, Timpani, Mutegtr,Shakazul,
                A half of the drum kit.

   (3) Other corrections made :
          Aurora             - the complete version...
          Halopad,Fantasia,
          Freshair,Unicorn   - Better looping and envelope.
          Choir -  Changed choir.pat sound so that the first (lowest)
                   wave is (also) from original GUS patch because it
                   differed too much from the other waves in the patch.
                   Thanks goes to Imre "LaLa" Olajos, Jr. who noted me
                   about this.
          
   (4) New patches:    
         Synbass2 - Much louder version of the GUS original.
         Slapbas2 -     "         "          "    
         Shakazul - Louder and better enveloped version of the GUS original.

   (5) I'am not sure, if the 1.0 version was MegaEm 2.xx compatible,
       after all. I don't know when the patches got incompatible, but
       it should work now ! 

   (6) If you already haven't collected a library of xxxxx midi files, there
       are now included few midi files in the "miditest" directory.
